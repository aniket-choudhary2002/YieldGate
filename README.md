This repository serves as a codebase for two overlapping projects:

- **Yieldgate** ([yieldgate.xyz](https://yieldgate.xyz)) is a protocol that allows anyone to start earning and building products with programmable yield. It originated as a finalist hackathon project at ETHIndia in Banglore.
- **Stake for Earth** ([stakefor.earth](https://stakefor.earth)) is a pool which generates compounding yield to enable climate action at 0 cost.

This project is backed by Aave, Toucan, The Graph, Polygon, Coinbase, and WalletConnect. ‚ù§Ô∏è
